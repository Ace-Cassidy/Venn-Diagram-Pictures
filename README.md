# Venn-Diagram-Pictures

A set of pregenerated venn diagram images for 2 and 3 set relations.

I created this because while i'm sure that there are other similar collections I wasn't able to find one.
I use these images primarily when writing LaTex documents as tikz is a bit overkill for simple venn diagrams.

The diagrams are named in binary based on which regions are shaded
